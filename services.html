<p class="bold">We offer a varied selection of packages to suit all businesses without any compromise on the quality of service we provide.</p>
<h3>Why are we unique?</h3>
<p>Well for starters, we offer your business a free, no obligation on-site survey this can save you £££££s on your PAT testing.</p>
<p class="bold">Transparent price structures, so you know what the final cost will be with no nasty little add ons.</p>
<p class="bold">Fantastic loyalty packages available for your business.</p>
<p class="bold">Friendly service offering you and your business free help and advice.</p>
<p>Also we only use the latest high-specification testing equipment and software available. This allows us to provide a detailed record of all the testing carried out on your premises. The testing equipment we use shows the time of each individual test and the readings of each test along with the appliance ID, appliance name, building, and room; this allows you to actually see the sequence of tests and the time between each test.</p>
<p>With this information available to you it will show that we are not just running around sticking green labels on all you appliances as fast as we can. This gives your business valid proof that the correct procedure is being carried out.</p>
<p>Without the actual readings you probably have no proof of any testing being carried out. In reality anybody can purchase green pass labels and stick them on appliances. We believe that most insurance companies would simply dismiss any claim if no real proof of PAT testing was available.</p>
<p class="bold">Having no proof of testing would also probably not stand up in a court of law.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The next step</h3>
<p class="bold">Once the PAT testing is completed we will supply all the test readings, store all the readings on our data bank and supply you with a top quality A4 certificate that you can display in your office or public area (extra certificates are also available).</p>
<p>We offer fantastic ongoing support should you have any questions regarding the PAT testing. We will also contact you when it is near to the due date for the next tests to be carried out and arrange a convenient time for the testing.</p>
<p>We don’t claim to be the cheapest, but believe in offering a fantastic service at a reasonable cost, with a long term commitment to your business.</p>
<p>We cover a wide range of businesses from small offices and workshops to holiday parks such as Sandy Bay in Exmouth, Devon.</p>
<hr />
