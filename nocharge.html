						<h1>Completely FREE of charge</h1>
						<p><b>Can you judge a good quality service? Cheap service is not always good service.</b></p>

						<p>That is why we offer your business free advice and a no obligation site survey, so together we can put a PAT testing program in place to suit your business needs. To enable PAT testing to be carried out correctly and without cutting corners any honest PAT testing company will tell you that the average tests you can carry out is approximately 12 to 17 per hour.</p>

						<p>We advise that one of the most important procedures of all is the formal visual inspection, and this is often overlooked by many companies.</p>
							<ul id="text-li">
								<li>FREE on-site survey</li>
								<li>FREE on-going help and advice</li>
								<li>FREE admin or set up charges for our loyalty packages (usually £40)</li>
								<li>FREE correct fuses where needed</li>
								<li>FREE rewiring of incorrect connections</li>
